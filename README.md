# Frontendmentor Tic Tac Toe

To run the project, clone first this [repository](https://github.com/pikapikamart/frontendmentor-tictactoe) and install. Then run via

```bash
npm run dev
```

Initially, you can interact with the offline app but not with with online version.

In order to to use it online mode, make sure to install first this current repository as it serves
as an external server for the `socket.io` to work properly. The same with the previous one, just use

```bash
npm run dev
```

Just make sure to update the cors.origin in the `app.ts` so that it allows your frontend to interact.

Thank you!
